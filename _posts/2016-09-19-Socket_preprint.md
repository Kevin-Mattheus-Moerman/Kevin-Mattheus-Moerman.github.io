# Automated and Data-driven Computational Design of Patient-Specific Biomechanical Interfaces
A new pre-print has been released about a novel design framework I have developed for biomechanical interfaces such as transtibial prosthetic sockets ([Moerman et al. _preprint_](https://engrxiv.org/g8h9n/)). I sometimes describe the development of such a framework as _Designing a designer to design designs_.

More to follow soon...
