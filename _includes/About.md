# About me
I am a research fellow at the [National University of Ireland Galway]( http://www.nuigalway.ie/). My research here focusses on computational biomechanics of blood clots and is part of the [INSIST project (In Silico Clinical Trials for Acute Ischemic Stroke)](https://www.insist-h2020.eu).

As part of my research I maintain the open source project [GIBBON](https://www.gibboncode.org/) which is a toolbox for computational (bio)mechanics.

I am also a research affiliate with the [MIT Media Lab's](https://www.media.mit.edu/) [Biomechatronics group](http://biomech.media.mit.edu/) where I used to lead the [Computational Biomechanics](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/mechanical-interfaces/overview/) research track. The research with MIT is focused on developing novel computational methods for automated and data-driven design of prosthetic interfaces (see also [Moerman et al. _preprint_](https://engrxiv.org/g8h9n/)).

Kevin M. Moerman is a computational (bio)mechanics and computational design expert. His research interests include soft tissue biomechanics, finite element analysis, continuum mechanics, image-based modeling, image-processing, medical device design, mechanobiology and morphogenesis. He holds a Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Master’s degree in Bioengineering and a PhD degree on the topic of soft tissue biomechanics (2012, Trinity College Dublin). Kevin joined the MIT Media Lab’s Biomechatronics group in 2015 as post-doctoral associate and became a Research Scientist in 2017 to lead the group's Computational Biomechanics research track. His research there focussed on computational modeling for automated subject-specific prosthetic socket design. Kevin is now a research fellow at NUI Galway where he works on computational biomechanics of blood clots. Kevin has shared his work at international conferences and is often involved in the organization of special sessions and workshops. During his academic career he has amassed a wealth of computational tools for image-based modeling and inverse finite element analysis, resulting in the creation of the <b><a href="https://www.gibboncode.org/">GIBBON open-source software project</a></b>.    
<br>
Kevin currently lives in Galway, Ireland, with his wife and two sons.
