# Introducing the Open Research Code Advocates (ORCA)
The [_Open Research Code Advocates (ORCA)_](https://openresearchcodeadvocates.github.io/ORCA/) initiative (launched after the 2017 [NUMFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/) Summit & Sustainability Workshop, October 10thâ€“11th, 2017) is a website where open source enthusiasts join as "advocates" to help promote open source. Advocates also help develop resources about open source software allowing the website to grow into the go-to resource to help convince coworkers about the importance of open source.

The ORCA project is still very much a work-in-progress. More details to follow...
